# Migration

## Q1. Read about VM migration in Xen

### a. Describe the differences between cold (or off-line ) migration and live migration

- cold migration: execution is stopped, network connections are dropped, the checkpoint is copied over, execution is restarted
- live migration: state is continuously copied over as things change, until a cutoff point where control is handed over. Execution never stops, connections are not dropped.

### b. What mechanism makes live migration almost instantaneous under light load?

- incremental / continuous copy of state while execution continues on the source machine.
- https://www.suse.com/c/xen-virtual-machine-migration/

## Q2. What are the technical requirements to be able to coldly migrate VMs and why?

- a way to transfer the state / checkpoint from one host to another: some way to move data
- compatible hosts that can both execute the guest: necessary for guest execution

## Q3. What are the technical requirements to be able to live migrate VMs and why?

- same as Q2
- shared storage mounted on same path: storage must be transparent to guest
- good connection: continous copy of state
- enough resources (ram/cpu) on target to execute the guest
- no special devices (pcie) attached

## Q4. Form a group of two and discuss how you are going to migrate VMs to each other's hypervisor Set up your systems so you can do both cold and live migrations Describe your setup in your logs Hint Do not use LVM Remember your eno2

## Q5. Together think of a definition of the downtime of a VM and how to best measure that downtime Write down your definition and measurement method(s) for both

downtime: period of time the guest is unavailable to perform tasks assigned to it.

- ex compute: period of time the guest is not running (executing useful things)
- ex network: period of time the guest is unreachable from the network

measurement method:

- compute: script in the vm to continuously check previous / current time: recording (large) breaks in time
- network: script from outside to continuously check ping connectivity to the guest, recording large breaks in connectivity

compute script:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import time

# print(time.clock_getres(time.CLOCK_REALTIME))

old = time.clock_gettime_ns(time.CLOCK_REALTIME)
cum, cnt = 0, 0

while True:
  cur = time.clock_gettime_ns(time.CLOCK_REALTIME)
  diff = cur - old
  if diff > 10000000:
    print('break,', diff, ",mean loop time,", cum / cnt)
  else:
    cum += diff
    cnt += 1
  old = cur
```

network script:

`ping -i 0.01 145.100.110.39 > aaa.out`

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

with open('aaa.out') as fp:
  lines = fp.readlines()
lines.pop(0)
lines.pop(-1)
lines.pop(-1)
lines.pop(-1)
lines.pop(-1)

count = 1
first_time = 0
last_time = 0

for line in lines:
  if 'From' in line:
    continue
  ping = line.split()
  ping = int(ping[4].split('=')[1])
  if ping != count:
    first_time = count
    last_time = ping
    count = last_time+1
    sq_missing = last_time - first_time
    print('Time average:')
    print((sq_missing+1)\*0.01)
    print('---------------------')
  else:
  count+=1
```

### a. Cold migration

test script:

```
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..10}; do
  xl save guest-05 /xen/nevers/guest-05.img && \
    ssh root@avignon.studlab.os3.nl xl restore /xen/nevers/guest-05.img
  echo "# "
  echo "# nevers -> avignon done \$i"
  echo "# "
  sleep 1

  ssh root@avignon.studlab.os3.nl xl save guest-05 /xen/nevers/guest-05.img && \
    xl restore /xen/nevers/guest-05.img
  echo "# "
  echo "# avignon -> nevers done $i"
  echo "# "
  sleep 1
done
```

### b. Live migration

test script:

```
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..10}; do
  xl migrate guest-05 avignon.studlab.os3.nl
  echo "# "
  echo "# nevers -> avignon done \$i"
  echo "# "
  sleep 1

  ssh root@avignon.studlab.os3.nl xl migrate guest-05 nevers.studlab.os3.nl
  echo "# "
  echo "# avignon -> nevers done $i"
  echo "# "
  sleep 1
done
```

===== Q6. Perform cold migrations with your partner and measure the downtime Do not take just a single measurement Compute mean and median of your chosen metric =====

- 10 cycles: 1 cycle = from `nevers` to `avignon` then back to `nevers`.
- Each migration was a single measurement: total 20 measurements

| time in ms | Compute Downtime | Network Downtime |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Mean       | 21228            | 5423             |
| Median     | 19529            | 5045             |
| stdev      | 4398             | 3686             |

We think the lower values for network downtime are a result of us using ping
which tests if the interface is responsive and not if the host itself is responsive

===== Q7. Perform live migrations with your partner and measure the downtime Compute mean and median of your chosen metric Performance There are various ways to set up shared storage for VM migration for instance using NFS and SMB two protocols that allow you to mount remote filesystems =====

- 10 cycles: 1 cycle = from `nevers` to `avignon` then back to `nevers`.
- Each migration was a single measurement: total 20 measurements

| time in ms | Compute Downtime | Network Downtime |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Mean       | 752              | 492              |
| Median     | 746              | 490              |
| stdev      | 30               | 12               |

===== Q8. What are the most important differences between NFS and SMB? Explain in approximately 200 words =====

===== Q9. Together with your partner design an experiment to compare the performance of NFS and SMB as VM shared storage Distinguish between raw I/O performance and the performance under a realistic workload E g what if the VM was running an Apache Web server? Discuss the design with a lab teacher =====

- `sudo apt install samba`
- edit `/etc/samba/smb.conf`
- `sudo mkdir /xen/samba`
- `sudo chown nobody:nogroup /xen/samba`
- `sudo systemctl restart smbd.service nmbd.service`

smb.conf:

```
[share]
comment = LS-2 test
path = /xen/samba
guest ok = yes
read only = no
create mask = 0755

```

- https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/samba-fileserver.html

===== Q10. Configure both NFS and SMB on your systems Perform the experiment and show the results in your log Try to explain any remarkable differences Hint root is a nobody when it comes to NFS =====

====== BONUS ======

===== Q11. Find out how the importing feature of Amazon works In which case would it be easier to migrate a VM to Amazon instead of just creating a new one? =====

===== Q12. Create a new PV machine with 6500 MB of disk space Make sure Apache is installed and is serving a web page Convert this PV machine to a HVM machine Document the steps you take There are many ways to do the conversion we provide a cheat sheet below if you don't want to get lost =====

===== Q13. Now migrate the disk to the Amazon cloud and create an instance with your volume Document which steps you took to get it to work Please make sure you use the t2 micro instance name all volumes and snapshots you create (unnamed ones are subject to deletion) delete all volumes and snapshots as soon as you are done This sounds draconic but S3 Storage is extremely expensive Last year we spent as much money on storage as on the whole of the Amazon lab Hint EC2 CLI EC2 volume upload (note ec2-instance-import is not working for us) =====

===== Q14. Show the Amazon cloud serving the web page on your server What are the differences between the imported VM against the VM running on your system? =====
